This are Bombable Carriers and Ships for Flightgear Flight Simulator and Bombable-5.0 addon. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________

To use Bombable-Carriers-Ships, install Bombabl-5.0 updated by Helijah. Install it as addon module into Flightgear.

Installation of Bombable-Carriers-Ships: Copy AI and Aircraft folder from Bombable-Carriers-Ships and paste it into your Flightgear installation, under fgdata folder. You can add Bombable-Objects to custom folder, and register it in FGFS, but AI must be added into fgdata/AI. Open file Add to fallback_ models.txt and copy models. Navigate to fgdata/AI/Aircraft folder, and open file fallback_models. Paste your selection to proper place, save file and you are done. AI folder contains AI Scenarios for Bombable-Objects.

Run it as AI scenario and bring it to your location, using Bombable addon menu, or use it as "airplane" and attack it in Multiplayer session.

Spawn at waypoint over the sea or use Flightgear menu, to change its position.

You can use it for landings in MP sessions only if it is static. To achieve no movement, pause Carrier. 

Remember that war is disaster for regular people and soldiers.
